# Simple Interest Calculator

A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Input:
- **p**: principal amount  
- **t**: time period in years  
- **r**: annual rate of interest

## Output:
- **simple interest** = p * t * r / 100

## Example
If p = 1000, t = 2 years, and r = 10%,  
then simple interest = 1000 * 2 * 10 / 100 = 200
